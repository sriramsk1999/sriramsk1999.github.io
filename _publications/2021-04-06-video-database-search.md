The number of videos being produced and con
sequently stored in databases for video streaming platforms
has been increasing exponentially over time. This vast database
should be easily indexable to find the requisite clip or video
to match the given search specification, preferably in the form
of a textual query. This work aims to provide an end-to-end
pipeline to search a video database with a voice query from the
end user. The pipeline makes use of Recurrent Neural Networks
in combination with Convolutional Neural Networks to generate
captions of the video clips present in the database.
