The number of videos being produced and consequently stored in databases for video streaming platforms has been increasing exponentially over time. This vast database should be easily indexable to find the requisite clip or video to match the given search specification, preferably in the formof a textual query. This work aims to provide an end-to-end pipeline to search a video database with a voice query from theend user. The pipeline makes use of Recurrent Neural Networks in combination with Convolutional Neural Networks to generate captions of the video clips present in the database.
