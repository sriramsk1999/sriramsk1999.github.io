The established way of interfacing with most computer systems is
a mouse and keyboard. Hand gestures are an intuitive and effective
touchless way to interact with computer systems. However, hand
gesture based systems have seen low adoption among end-users
primarily due to numerous technical hurdles in detecting in-air
gestures accurately. This paper presents Gestop, a framework de-
veloped to bridge this gap. The framework learns to detect gestures
from demonstrations, is customizable by end-users and enables
users to interact in real-time with computers having only RGB
cameras, using gestures.
