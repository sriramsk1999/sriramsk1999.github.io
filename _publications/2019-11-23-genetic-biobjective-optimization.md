The search for life outside the Solar System is an endeavour
of astronomers all around the world. With hundreds of exoplanets be
ing discovered due to advances in astronomy, there is a need to classify
the habitability of these exoplanets. This is typically done using various
metrics such as the Earth Similarity Index or the Planetary Habitability
Index. In this paper, Genetic Algorithms are used to evaluate the best
possible habitability scores using the Cobb-Douglas Habitability Score.
Genetic Algorithm is a classic evolutionary algorithm used for solving op
timization problems. The working of the algorithm is established through
comparison with various benchmark functions and its functionality is ex
tended to Multi-Objective optimization. The Cobb-Douglas Habitability
Function is formulated as a bi-objective as well as a single objective
optimization problem to find the optimal values to maximize the Cobb-
Douglas Habitability Score for a set of promising exoplanets.
