**mlmonad** intends to be a technical blog covering foundational / seminal concepts across Computer Science and Machine Learning, with a focus on my own interests - Computer Vision / Robotics. The goal is to thoroughly understand the pillars of the field, while serving as an avenue for exploring interesting concepts and cool tools. Each blogpost will tackle one concept, covering:
- Motivation and existing work
- A detailed explanation embracing theory / formulae
- Toy example worked out by hand
- Self-contained code implementation in a literate programming style
- Visualizations
- Future Work
