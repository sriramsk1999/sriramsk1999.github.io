**mlmonad** intends to be a technical blog series covering foundational / seminal concepts across Computer Science and Machine Learning, with a focus on my own interests - Computer Vision / Robotics.

The goal is to thoroughly understand the pillars of our field, while serving as an avenue for exploring interesting concepts (How exactly does version control work?) and cool tools (JAX? Haskell?).

Each blogpost will tackle one concept, covering:
- Motivation and existing work
- A detailed explanation embracing theory / formulae
- Toy example worked out by hand
- Self-contained code implementation in a literate programming style
- Visualizations
- Future Work
