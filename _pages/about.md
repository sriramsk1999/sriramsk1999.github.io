I am an Associate Software Engineer at [**Nextuple**](https://www.nextuple.com/), working on building Nextuple's Machine Learning platform. I am also a Research Assistant at the [**MIDAS lab in IIIT-Delhi**](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/), where I am currently working on uncertainty in Automatic Essay Scoring (AES) systems. I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from PES University in June 2021 with a specialization in Data Science.

While my research interests are still nascent, broadly speaking, I am interested in the design, development and most importantly, enhancement of ML systems, exploring their limits and improving upon them. Over the course of my undergraduate degree and accompanying internships, I have worked in varied domains from genetically trained neural networks to gesture recognition systems, each bringing its own challenges and learning.
