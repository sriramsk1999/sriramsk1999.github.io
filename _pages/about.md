I am a Masters in Robotics student at [**The Robotics Institute @ Carnegie Mellon University**](https://www.ri.cmu.edu). I'm a member of the [Robots Perceiving and Doing Lab (R-PAD)](https://r-pad.github.io/), and advised by [Prof. David Held](https://davheld.github.io).

My research lies at the intersection of Computer Vision and Robot Learning for Manipulation. I'm interested in building systems that can extract useful information from messy real-world data, and learning generalizable representations for manipulation that enable cross-embodiment transfer.

Previously, I was a Software Engineer at [Samsung Research](https://www.research.samsung.com/), where I worked on Depth Estimation and 3D Scene Reconstruction. Prior to this, I was an Associate Software Engineer at [Nextuple](https://www.nextuple.com/), where I helped set up Nextuple's Machine Learning platform. I also spent a period of time as a Research Assistant at the [MIDAS lab in IIIT-Delhi](http://midas.iiitd.ac.in/). I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from [PES University](https://pes.edu/) in 2021 with a specialization in Data Science.
