I am a Software Engineer at [**Samsung Research**](https://www.research.samsung.com/), working in the AR Vision Lab on Depth Estimation and 3D Scene Reconstruction.

Previously, I was an Associate Software Engineer at [**Nextuple**](https://www.nextuple.com/), where I worked on setting up Nextuple's Machine Learning platform. I also spent a period of time as a Research Assistant at the at the [**MIDAS lab in IIIT-Delhi**](http://midas.iiitd.ac.in/). I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from PES University in June 2021 with a specialization in Data Science.

My research interests are primarily in 3D Vision and understanding the world in 3D. I'm interested in figuring out how we can develop agents to perceive, understand and plan in the 3D world, without explicit supervision. In other words, I want to [build a cat.](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1622300311573651458?lang=en)
