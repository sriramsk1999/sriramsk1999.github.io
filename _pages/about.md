> A man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what are the heavens for?

I am an Associate Software Engineer at [**Nextuple**](https://www.nextuple.com/), working on building Nextuple's Machine Learning platform. I am also a Research Assistant at the [**MIDAS lab in IIIT-Delhi**](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/), where I am currently working on keyphrase extraction and event detection to extract the main events in news articles. I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from PES University in June 2021 with a specialization in Data Science.

While my research interests are still nascent, broadly speaking, I am interested in the design, development and enhancement of ML systems, exploring their limits and improving upon them. Over the course of the previous few years, I have worked in varied domains from Gesture Recognition to human-in-the-loop Automated Scoring systems, each bringing its own challenges and learning.
