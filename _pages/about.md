> **A man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?** - Robert Browning

I am a Software Engineer at [**Samsung Research**](https://www.research.samsung.com/), working in the AR Vision Lab on 3D Scene Reconstruction and Spatial Mapping. I am also a Research Assistant at the [**MIDAS lab in IIIT-Delhi**](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/), where I am currently working on keyphrase extraction and event detection to extract the main events in news articles. 

Previously, I was an Associate Software Engineer at [**Nextuple**](https://www.nextuple.com/), where I built Nextuple's Machine Learning platform. I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from PES University in June 2021 with a specialization in Data Science.

As a fledgling researcher, my research interests are still nascent. Broadly speaking, I am interested in the design, development and enhancement of ML systems, exploring their limits and improving upon them. Over the course of the previous few years, I have worked in varied domains from Gesture Recognition to human-in-the-loop Automated Scoring systems.
